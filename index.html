                            The Mandalay Hill is situated to the north-east corner of the Mandalay Royal Palace. It lies from the north to the south, and its altitude is estimated around 236.5 metres above sea level and its height is going up to 167 meters.

There are two stairways to the southern. The easier path starts between two giant Chinthe statues, a kind of mythical hybrid creature of lion and dragon, with 1729 steps. And there is another alternative southeast stairway that is better for glimpsed views but harder to climb. These two routes converge at a shrine housing a large statue of a standing Buddha, whose arm points towards the royal palace.
This scene refers to a legend in which the historical Buddha, accompanied by his disciple Ananda in the climb on the Mandalay Hill, prophesied that after 2400 years a great city would be founded below.

                            Mandalay Palace was the primary royal residence of King Mindon and King Thibaw - the last two kings of the country. The British turned the palace compound into “Fort Dufferin” during their colonial period, and named the palace after the viceroy of India. Throughout the British colonial era, the palace was seen by the Burmese as the primary symbol of sovereignty and identity. Much of the palace compound was destroyed during World War II by allied bombing and has been rebuilt using forced labor. Only one major wooden building was left to survive – the Shwenandaw Monastery, which is built completely of teak and decorated throughout with detailed and ornate carvings. The watch tower and royal mint were also heavily damaged.

                            The Shwenandaw Monastery was originally part of the Royal Palace in Amarapura. When the capital city was moved to Mandalay, the building was dismantled, transported to Mandalay and rebuild there as part of the new all teak Royal Palace in 1857. King Mindon used the building as his personal living quarters. After the King died, his son relocated the building to its current location outside of the Palace grounds, where it was converted into a monastery in 1880.

The Golden Palace Monastery is a great place to get an impression of what the Royal Palace once must have looked like. As the Palace was destroyed by fire during the second World War, the Shwenandaw Monastery is the only major original teak wooden building left of the original Mandalay Royal Palace.
